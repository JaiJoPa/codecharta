## refactoring

-    refactoring of algorithm needs more work, maybe abstract the layout Generator for both street and squared layout.
-    unit tests not implemented yet. 

## bugs

-    height is not calculated properly. 
-    manual margin is not working. 

## improvement

-    scaling is not same in both algorithm.
-    no label on streets.
-    autocentering the camera does not always fit the label, the bounding box should include the labels.
